                    <p className="mb-4">
                      If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
                      informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
                      expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively
                      resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
                      WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                      COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be
                      commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
                      Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and,
                      where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for
                      Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of
                      which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your
                      arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
                      shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where
                      appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
                      arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                      submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
                      arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
                      provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                      Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                      award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
                      Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA
                      rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
                      in California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
                      Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                      proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
                      vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                      arbitrator.

                      If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than

                      in the state and federal courts located in California, and
                      the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
